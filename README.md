# [Gandalf The Gay](https://gandalf-the.gay)

After I recently learned that there is a '.gay' TLD, 
me and a friend imagined some puns in the form 'something.gay'. 
Of couse [ha.gay](https://ha.gay) was already taken, but [gandalf-the.gay](https://gandalf-the.gay)
was not! 

So here we are.

## Pride
I stand in solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and this work is not meant disrespectivly towards the community in any way. 

Start thinking about how you can support your local LGBTQ+ community or consider [funding a project to stop discrimination of queer people](https://www.google.com/search?q=lgbtq%20community%20unterst%C3%BCtzen).

## Copyright
[Original Image](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Gandalf?file=Gandalf_the_Grey.jpg)
Of course I do not own the used image. It is unlicensed. 
Since I live in germany, german copyright might(*) apply and
since `gandalf.png` is smaller than 125 kilobytes
it is ["Mutma√ülich erlaubte Nutzung"](https://www.bgbl.de/xaver/bgbl/start.xav?startbk=Bundesanzeiger_BGBl&jumpTo=bgbl121s1204.pdf#__bgbl__%2F%2F*%5B%40attr_id%3D%27bgbl121s1204.pdf%27%5D__1626902599893) until 
New Line Cinema says otherwise. (New law in 2021)

(*) "might" because github servers are probably not in germany. Then US-Law might apply. Or British law. Or Greenland law. Whoever knows. 
Copyright in the digital age is complicated...
